Description: This project that I was interested in undertaking is through how machine learning and AI can be used in health. 
As a result, I particularly used Machine Learning in order predict the presence of Parkinson's disease in an individual.

Environmental Setup and Dependencies: The environmental setup and dependencies to use for this model to accurately predict the presence of Parkinson's disease is varied.
The most important environment setup is using numpy and pandas. NumPy is used for scientific computing throuhg using nubers while pandas is used for data manipulation. 

Step by Step Instruction:
